## API (C# Azure Functions)

The API provides endpoints for retrieving content, searching, and managing blog posts. It's built using C# Azure Functions and connects to Azure Cosmos DB for data storage.

See the [API README](/api/README.md) for more details.

## Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend is a responsive web application built with Next.js and React. It provides a user-friendly interface for accessing the goat farming guide content.

See the [Frontend README](/frontend/README.md) for more details.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) for the API
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later) for the frontend
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools) for local API development

### Running the API

1. Navigate to the `/api` directory
2. Configure the `local.settings.json` file with your connection strings and API keys
3. Run `func start` to start the API locally

### Running the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `/frontend` directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Deployment

### API Deployment

The API can be deployed to Azure Functions using the Azure CLI, Visual Studio, or the Azure Portal.

```bash
cd api
func azure functionapp publish <your-function-app-name>
```

### Frontend Deployment

The frontend can be deployed to Vercel, Netlify, or any other static site hosting service.

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# Deploy the .next directory according to your hosting provider's instructions
```

## Authentication

The API includes basic authentication for certain endpoints. Currently, a hardcoded token is used for demonstration purposes.

## Headless CMS Integration

The project includes integration with a headless CMS (Contentful) for managing content. The API includes endpoints for retrieving content from the CMS.
