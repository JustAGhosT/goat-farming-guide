## Headless CMS Implementation
This project uses a headless CMS to manage and deliver content. The headless CMS allows for easy content creation, management, and distribution across different platforms. The configuration for the headless CMS can be found in the `cms/config.js` file. The content is fetched from the headless CMS using the API endpoint in `api/content/getContent/index.js` and displayed on the `frontend/pages/content.js` page.

## Authentication Implementation
This project includes a basic authentication mechanism to restrict access to certain features. The authentication is currently hardcoded for demonstration purposes. Only authenticated users can add or edit blogs. The authentication check is implemented in the `api/content/addEditBlog/index.js` file and the `frontend/pages/blogs.js` page.
